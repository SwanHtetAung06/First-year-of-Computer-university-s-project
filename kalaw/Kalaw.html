                Kalaw is located in the southern part of Shan State. It is located at an altitude of 4297 feet above sea level. The Union Highway passes through Kalaw. Kalaw is bordered by Aung Pan Township to the east and Mandalay Region to the west. It is like a gateway from southern Shan State to central Myanmar. To the east of the city is the Kalaw Stream, which flows from the mountains and flows into Inle Lake .
            Kalaw's history dates back to the time of the ancient Burmese kings, when it was just a stopover on the way to Shan State. During the colonial period, the British liked it and built it according to the characteristics of the city.
            As the name suggests, "The City of Pine Trees," the lush green pine trees, the friendly and honest locals, the fresh fruits, the traditional Shan food, the mountains, and the clouds, all make Kalaw a city that will make you want to visit again and again

                    Kalaw Local Market
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The market is held every 5 days because vendors from various parts of Shan State, such as Kalaw, Pindaya, Heho, Aung Pan, and Pinlaung, take turns gathering and selling.
                    The taste of local food, a variety of foods, fresh fruits, assorted dishes, and hot fried foods makes Kalaw worth visiting.

                <h2>O Si Mountain</h2>
                <p>
                    O Si Mountain is over 4500 feet high, but you can drive up to half of the mountain.
                    From the parking lot, you can walk up a small staircase for about 10 minutes to reach the top. When you reach the top, you can see the town of Kalaw below, the clouds floating around in winter mornings, you can see the sea of clouds, and in the mornings after the rain.The 360' view of the lush greenery surrounding the mountains is refreshing. The sunrise is one thing, and the sunset is another.
