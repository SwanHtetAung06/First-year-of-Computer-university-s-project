                <h2>
                    TAZAUNGDAING FESTIVAL (27TH NOVEMBER 2023)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If your idea of fun involves a blurry riot of colour and explosions, 
                    look no further than the Taunngyi Fire Balloon Festival, which takes place in the culturally diverse capital 
                    of Shan State over several days every November. This celebration is held around the Full Moon of Tazaungmon,
                    a Myanmar national holiday that marks the end of rainy season and is also known as the Tazaungdaing Festival of Lights.
                    Traditionally, it is a festival to pay homage to the Sulamani Pagoda by sending up decorated hot air balloons,
                    and lately it also became as a Hot Air Balloon Competition Festival and the festival is divided into two parts;
                    daytime competition and nighttime competition. In the daytime, hot air balloons are sent up with the shapes of various animals and mythical creatures, and hot air balloons with firework & fire-cracker (known as Nya Mee Gyi) and lot of lanterns are hanging in the hot air balloons (known as Seinnaban) are sent up in the nighttime. Although the releasing of balloons is nominally an offering to the heavens to ward away evil spirits, and the national holiday is rooted in Buddhist and Hindu cosomology (it is also celebrated in Thailand, where it is known as Loi Krathong), the tradition of hot air balloon competition in Taunggyi was actually begun by the British in the late 19th century. The Pa-O tribal community makes giant paper balloons,
                    often in the shape of animals, which are floated up into the sky day and night in a series of competitions.

                <p>
                    The land route for tour groups starting from Taunggyi is possible and accessible for all year round. But tours originated from Inle Lake are considered to be possible only in the open season from late October to early May or before heavy rain falls.
                    The yearly religious festival normally takes about one week. The climax of this festival usually falls on full moon of the Tabaung (Mid-March) every year. The Kekku pagodas  festival also draws thousands of visitors from all parts of the Shan State

                    A hidden treasure an unusual, magnificent collection of Buddhist Stupas unheard of by historians and unlisted in guide books lies in the deepest Pa-oh territory, 26 miles south of  Taunggyi the capital of Shan State. There lies more than 2000 stupas in a site closely packed together in ranks covering an area of approximately a square kilometer apparently  unknown to outside world. Kekku area is covered and scattered by Pa-oh villages especially stretching along on both sides of the main road from north to south.

                    Pindaya is a small quiet town perched on the bank of the palcid Botoloke Lake.
                    Pindaya cave is a huge cavern where hundreds and thoundsands of Buddha images 
                    in various size  and shape are installed since the 11th century. The winding 
                    galleries and nooks and corners are ideal places of insight meditation since the olden days.
                    Huge monastery compounds with numerous pagodas and temples in different stages of dilapidation
                    are much respected by such ethnic groups as the Shans,
                    Danus and Paos living in the environs of Pindaya
