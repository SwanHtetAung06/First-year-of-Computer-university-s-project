                <p>
                    Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda is one of the holiest places in Shan State. The shrine is massive and houses five ancient golden Buddha statues. There’s also this huge golden barge, a replica of the one King Alaung Sithu supposedly used for his travels. During the annual pagoda festival, this barge gets towed by long boats, visiting over 20 villagers.

                    Back in 1965, when the barge was carrying the five Buddha images, it sank, and all the statues fell into the lake. People dived in to search and managed to recover four of them, but the fifth one was missing. After a long search, they gave up and returned to the pagoda — only to find the missing image miraculously back in its shrine. Since then, the fifth Buddha image always stays in its shrine during the boat tours.

                    The pagoda festival runs for 18 days between September and October during Thadingyut. It’s a must-visit for both locals and tourists, especially because of the iconic rowing competitions between villages, where rowers use the unique one-leg rowing technique.
